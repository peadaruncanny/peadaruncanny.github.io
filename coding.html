                <p>Worked with Yannis Kyriakides and members of HIIIT to develop bespoke code that is able to process and map data received from the MYO sensors to plugins and sound processors directly inside Ableton using Max4Live.</p>
                    
                <p>The interface used to broadcast the data from the MYOs to a computer was built by <a target="_blank" href="https://micheleabolaffio.wordpress.com/works/unmute/">Michele Abolaffio</a> using Raspberry Pi and OSC protocol for the piece <a target="_blank" href="https://www.kyriakides.com/unmute.html">unmute</a> also by Yannis Kyriakides in collaboration with choreographer Keren Levi. Michele's code can be found <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/Sindel/myo-to-osc">here</a>.</p>

                <p>My Max4Live devices - <b>Ableton x Myo</b> - were built on top of this framework. The <b>Ableton x Myo - Connector</b></i> device makes the connection with the Raspberry Pi via the OSC protocol. The <b>Ableton x Myo - Data Processor and Mapper</b> is used to make a simple data processor - scaling, offset, trigger mode - and the data point can be mapped to Ableton parameters directly as with other devices (like LFOs). The device doesn't output in MIDI format (yet).</p>

                <p>The <b>Ableton x Myo</b> devices can be found on my <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/peadaruncanny/Ableton-x-Myo">GitHub</a>.</p>

            <div class="description">
                    
                <p>In this research project by dancer and choreographer Mireia Varón Gallofré, she wishes to explore accessibility within movement and sound performance practices. Her focus was on the experience of visually impaired people. The participants had mixed degrees of visual impairedness: from totally blind from birth to acquired partial blindness due to health issues throughout their lives.</p>

                <p>The project consisted of several tryout and discussion sessions with volunteers-participants that Mireia was able to get in contact with through organisations that promote cultural work specifically for the visually impaired. The focus, this time, was on the use of (participative) movement technology that the participants could use. For this, she asked me to prepare code and sound that would be used in the workshops for the participants to perform with/through. MYO sensors and SOMI-1 sensors were used. <a target="_blank" href="https://mireiavaron.com/research/movement-sound-exploration-with-motion-sensor-thechnology"></p>

                <p>See here</a> some documentation from the research and sessions.</p>
