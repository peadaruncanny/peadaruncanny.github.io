            <div><p>Twitch_Plays_Max is an experiment on connectivity. With social distancing and lockdowns happening throughout the world the physical spaces of the concert hall and theatre hall have been put on hiatus, in some cases even destroyed due to lack of funding. It falls on the shoulders of young artists to create an alternative to these communal art locations.</p></div>

            <div><p>With this internet sound installation, I aim to break the barriers between audience and performance, making the audience a central part of the performance itself. By inputting specific words the listener has the power to shape the musical discourse as they see fit. Multiply that interaction 50 fold and we achieve a sort of collective improvisation. That is to say, the result is a collective artwork created in real time by the joint effort of all the listeners/performers, a motto that has become central to me in this kind of art form.</p></div>
