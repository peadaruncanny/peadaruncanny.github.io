            <div><p><i>The other day</i> intends to have a constructive outlook on the issue of violence perpetrated and perpetuated by oppressive structures against non-normative bodies - one example being Queer existences, as myself. I propose that by making tangible the fact that, even when bound by organic structures, non-normative bodies can exist beyond their normal capacities with the use of technology, we gain agency and feel empowered by tapping into a potential that is hidden within us, but already there nonetheless. For me, part of this process was realising that my body can exist beyond flesh and bone. It exists in the memory of others, it contains lived experiences and is made up of more than just myself: I carry with me everyone that I have met.</p></div>

            <div><p>This thought process is profoundly inspired by my use of technology as a method of Queer empowerment, especially in my teenage years (the only way I could feel empowered when I lived in a hostile environment), and by the, in my opinion, very Queer attitude of living a mutable and flexible existence and personhood.</p></div>

            <div><p>For this piece, I did not want to work with a fixed score as it didn't make sense for a piece about the possibility of translating my body into any medium. Instead, I devised an algorithm, in Max/MSP, that would use voice as an input and make a very basic separation of the phonetic content. This information is then collected and processed in order to create a score that the musicians need to interpret and follow in real time. The analysed vocal information also feeds a live electronics system.</p></div>
