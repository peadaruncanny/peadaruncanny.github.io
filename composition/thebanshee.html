        <div class="pieceText">
            <div><p>This piece is based on a single recording I made of the Irish satire song “Johnny Seoighe” when I was in An Cheathrú Rua (Connemara). It is one of the few surviving Irish language songs from the time of the so-called Irish Famine (read genocide) and it speaks of Tomás' attempt to find a job at a workhouse in order to be able to feed his family. The local British relieving officer denied this request.</p></div>

            <div><p>We accompany Tomás on his long way home. A Banshee — a female spirit in Irish folklore who announces the death of family members — is heard keening distantly, foreshadowing the passing of his family from hunger and exhaustion. Embodied by the recorded singer — a native Irish speaker, of whom there are very few —, the Banshee is herself a ghostly witness and symbol of the partial destruction of Irish culture and language by the British colonial occupation.</p></div>

            <div><p>Decades later, the island is still coming to terms and mourning the loss of a quarter of its population, either by hunger or displacement, and working towards the revival of the Irish language and reconnecting with pre-colonial cultural practices and identity.</p></div>

            <div><p>This piece was premiered at the <a target="_blank" href="https://sonology.org/festival-with-wave-field-synthesis-compositions/">Wave Field Synthesis Festival 2024</a>, in the New Music Lab (Royal Conservatoire of The Hague), Amare.
