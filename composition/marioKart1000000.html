            <div><p>During my first months in The Netherlands in 2019, I bought a Nintendo Switch and
                started playing Mario Kart with my roommates. When I found out that Joy-Cons (Nintendo
                Switch controllers) could be connected to a computer, I started working on a piece for ensemble
                which used them as interfaces for musicians to play with. Due to the Corona Pandemic, this
                piece never came to fruition.</p></div>

            <div><p>During the Pandemic, due to the gigantic amounts of free time that needed to be spent
                at home, I started playing even more Mario Kart with my roommates. We would spend 3 to 4
                hours glued to a TV screen playing the game.</p></div>

            <div><p>In this piece, while 4 people are playing the game, the controller information is, at the
                same time, sent to Max/MSP in order to feed synthesis processes and live-manipulate the
                original soundtrack of the game. This controller data is also sent to an AI which's learning material
                is the soundtracks of three iterations of Mario Kart which I have played myself: Mario Kart for
                Nintendo DS (my first ever handheld console); Mario Kart 7 for 3DS; Mario Kart 8 for Nintendo
                Switch.</p></div>

            <div><p>The piece is somewhat an homage to the people (and game) that kept me
                sane throughout the weird times of the Corona Pandemic.</p></div>

            <div><p>This piece was premiered by Dustin James, Julia Bovee-Schroeder and Sergi(a) Vilavella Font at the <i>CAAOSSS Concert</i> in Amare, The Hague.</p></div>
