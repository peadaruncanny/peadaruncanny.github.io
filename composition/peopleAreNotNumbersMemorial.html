            <div><p>On the 29th of September of 2020 the (registered) global death tolls due to covid-19 reaches 1 million.</p></div>

            <div><p>Being bombarded with huge numbers, statistics and even false information leads to getting detached from reality and dehumanising the pandemic situation. All in all 800 deaths means 800 stories lost, 800 families in pain and 800 new burials. And these losses happen daily.</p></div>

            <div><p>In this piece Paula tells us the story of her father's passing on the 25th of March of 2020 and how the corona related restrictions have affected her mourning process. She shares how she dealt with the altered funerary rites and why she feels that her mourning is, and probably will remain, incomplete.</p></div>

            <div><p>A big, heartfelt thank you to Paula for sharing her story.</p></div>

            <div><p>This piece was premiered at <a target="_blank" href="https://www.projecto-dme.org/2022/01/signes-emergents.html">Signes Ã‰mergents</a> in Lisboa Incomum, Lisboa.</p></div>
