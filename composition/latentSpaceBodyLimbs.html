            <div><p><i>In Machine Learning, Latent Space is an abstract n-dimensional space where learned information is mapped onto. One can then navigate the in-between of these points. This could be representative of Queer existences in a heteronormative world. Queer lives are the in-between which defy fixed and oppressive structures, degrading Western conceptions of what identity and bodies can be.</i></p></div>

            <div><p><i>Latent Space / Body: limbs</i> is a first endeavour on the creation of a long-duration solo sound and body performance. Lately, I've been interested in Neural Networks and how they can relate to Queer Bodies. The case of the Autoencoder, a type of AI architecture, is especially relevant: you give AI sound information from which to learn and then it maps it onto points inside what is called a latent space, an abstract n-dimensional parameter space. By navigating the latent space, one is able to “reconstruct” the information learned but most importantly, by selecting a point in the coordinate system which “doesn't exist”, the AI can infer what it should be/sound like.</p></div>

            <div><p>To me, this is representative of Queer existences in a  heteronormative world. Queer lives are the in-between which defy fixed and oppressive structures, thus degrading Western conceptions of what identity and bodies can and should be. These Queer bodies, that escape a fixed grid and are in constant mutability, are full of beauty and potential of creation and can be affirmed with the help of technology.</p></div>

            <div><p>To navigate the latent space of the AI of this piece (and other electronic manipulation processes), I make use of MYO sensors: a pair of bracelets that can, amongst other things, track muscle movement data of the forearms. While the piece is not focused on the technology of the MYOs in themselves, using them allows me to engage in an act of deep appreciation and care for my muscles, tendons, fingers and hands: a "narrative of poses" naturally arises. My recent practice in Voguing, a dance/performance practice within the Ballroom Scene developed in the 70s (New York) for the celebration of Queer bodies - particularly POC trans and gay bodies - was also influential to guide the creation of this "narrative of poses" since the movements, to an extent, embody a history of struggles and victories of those that have fought for emancipation. Celebrating memory and lineage is a central topic in the Ballroom Scene - especially improtant due to the ammount of deaths during the HIV/AIDS crisis.</p></div>
