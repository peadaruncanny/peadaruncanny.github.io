            <div><p>“When not sharing time or space, when not having the possibility to physically touch and intervene, can we be witness to each other?” - Caroline Nevejan in <i>Witnessing you</i></p></div>

            <div><p>This piece makes use of simple interactions between players through a computer or tablet screen. I created an interactive system with which the players send messages of “Stop playing” or “Play with me” and react to images taken by Sabina Mérida Entrocassi as their main musical material. These pictures were taken in informal settings and are bilingual: English and Catalan (Sabina's native language). They intend to invite the players to immerse themselves in Sabina's emotional space who, as a migrant originally from Argentina, is split between several “homes” and “language spaces” with which to express herself in.</p></div>

            <div><p>This piece was premiered by the <a target="_blank" href="https://www.maze.nu/">MAZE ensemble</a> at the online Spring Festival 2021 in the old building of the Royal Conservatoire of The Hague (Juliana van Stolberglaan).</p></div>
