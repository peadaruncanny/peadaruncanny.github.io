            <div><p>The camera picks up our face, the computer turns it into bytes, then they become light on a fibre-optic cable. This cable reaches somewhere, light turns to bytes and bytes become a face on a computer screen. What happens to our physical bodies in this trip at the speed of light?</p></div>

            <div><p>In this performance two people are eager to engage with each other through a network. To talk with each other, to interact with each other, to feel the softness and warmth of their skin when giving a hug. They are eager to witness each other in a very real way, even though they are separated by a barrier.</p></div>

            <div><p>Is this enough though? Will we ever be able to build a replacement for real human contact which pleases our needs to socialise and witness other people in the realest way possible? Can beams of matter-less light accurately translate our very matter-full bodies?</p></div>

            <div><p>The text was written by Sabina Mérida Entrocassi. I asked her to write it in Catalan since it's one of her native languages and with which she prefers to write in. In the text, Sabina reflects on the fact that the Internet is actually “a bunch of cables deep in the ocean” and what that entails when our “corporeality fades” into light and goes at its speed.</p></div>
