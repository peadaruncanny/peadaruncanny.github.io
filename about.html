        <p>Pedro Latas (They / He) is a composer, multimedia artist, performer and creative coder from Portugal, currently based in The Hague, The Netherlands.</p>

        <p>Their work draws inspiration from their own queer identity as well as other queer experiences in a world that seeks to suppress non-normative bodies and existences.</p>

        <p>Driven by the struggle for body autonomy and integrity, Pedro researches the deeply rooted interconnections between digital media and how it reframes the inherent entanglement between human bodies and their environments. Their work focuses then mostly on the production of computer-assisted performances and live (interactive or generated) electronics.</p>

        <p>From ensemble works to solo live-electronics performance, Pedro wishes to engage in radical acts of appreciation of - and care for - the human body, finding beauty and power in all the limitations it entails. Through these acts, Pedro hopes that radical acts of solidarity towards one another will naturally arise.</p>
