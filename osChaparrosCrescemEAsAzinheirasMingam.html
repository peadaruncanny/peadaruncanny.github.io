        <div><p>For the 1st edition of the Évora Contemporary Music Festival, I was asked by Projecto DME to create a fixed media piece that would somewhat touch upon traditional music practices from my home region, Alentejo.</p></div>

        <div><p>I sought to analyse and reflect upon my relationship towards these tradional music practices. Despite having been born in a region with a rich and internationally recognized singing and playing tradition - particularly Cante Alentejano -, it's difficult not to feel detached from it due to the lack of its presence in my music (and cultural) education.</p></div>

        <div><p>I haven't interacted with these traditions in a meaningful manner, thus making me feel like they are akeen to a cloud of mist: constantly surrounding me but impossible to touch. The songs present in this piece were sung by my grandmother. She used to sing and listen to them when working the fields.</p></div>

        <div><p>This piece was premiered at the <a target="_blank" href="https://www.projecto-dme.org/2021/09/festival-musica-contemporanea-evora-2021.html?m=1">Évora Contemporary Music Festival 2021</a> at Universidade de Música de Évora, Évora. Photo by Mike The Axe.</p></div>
