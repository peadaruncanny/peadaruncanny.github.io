                <p>The medieval music ensemble, <a target="_blank" href="https://sibillaensemble.com/">Sibil•la</a>, located in The Netherlands draws inspiration from the Sibyls, female prophetesses whose influence spanned from pagan times to the medieval era and the Renaissance. The ensemble combines sacred and secular music from Western medieval rituals and traditions. Focused on the repertoire from the 11th century to the 15th, it consists of voices and historical instruments such as vielle, gothic harp, recorders, organetto, medieval lute, hurdy-gurdy and percussion.</p>

                <p>The mystical concept of Viriditas originates from the theological writings of the German Benedictine abbess, composer, philosopher, and polymath Hildegard von Bingen (1098-1179). It symbolizes the vibrant, life-giving energy that permeates the natural world, embodying the essence of greenness and flora. The performance introduces a new collaboration between the Sibil•la Ensemble and myself and Alem (Alex Mastichiadis) as sound artists, blending medieval chants and secular songs that celebrate the force of nature with avant-garde electronic soundscapes.

                <p>The <b>Viriditas X</b> performance took place at the <a target="_blank" href="https://new-european-bauhaus.europa.eu/events/festival/fest/sibilla-ensemble-nl_en">New European Bauhaus Festival</a> on the 10th of April, 2024, in Brussels, BE.</p>

                    <p>Faux, consisting of Hugo Ariëns on prepared object guitar, Otis Thomet on modular synth, Pedro Latas on computer electronics, Quartus Vlak drums and percussion, plays free improvised music. Faux’s practice is intimately concerned with questions surrounding knowledge and difference. Welcoming our difference, not only in instrumentation ranging from purely acoustic to digital but also in our individual musical biographies spanning from classic conservatory education, pop, jazz and underground music practices, as a structure from which a musicking that is not located in the individual can emerge. Understanding musical improvisation as a form of collective knowledge creation, where knowledge is an action rather then an artifact. We hone in on the collective properties of our musicking, embracing the potential discomfort of our difference and give space to let distributed cognition arise.</p>
